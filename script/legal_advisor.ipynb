He can be tried and convicted of murder in any place in Pakistan in which he may be found.     5[] 5   6[(c) C, a foreigner who is in the service of Pakistan commits a murder in London. He can be tried and convicted of murder at any place in Pakistan in which he may be found.] 6   (d) D, a British subject living in Junagadh, instigates E to commit a murder in Lahore. D is guilty of abetting murder.       7[  5. Certain laws not to be affected by this Act. Nothing in this Act is intended to repeal, vary, suspend or affect any of the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny and desertion of officers, soldiers, sailors or airmen in the service of the State or of any special or local law.   ] 7   CHAPTER II GENERAL EXPLANATIONS 6. Definitions in the code to be understood subject to exceptions. Throughout this Code every definition of an offence, every penal provision and every illustration of every such definition or penal provision, shall be understood subject to the exceptions contained in the chapter entitled \"General Exceptions,\" though those exceptions are not repeated in such definition, penal provision or illustration.  Illustrations (a) The sections in this Code, which contains definitions of offences, do not express that a child under seven years of age cannot commit such offences; but the definitions are to be understood subject to the general exception which provides that nothing shall be an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age.    (b) A, a police officer, without warrant, apprehends Z who has committed murder. Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z, and, therefore, the case falls within the general exception which provides that \"nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it.\"'}]"

         "Explanation: It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.Illustrations (a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board; unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him incurring the risk of running down C.    (b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading.He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property.Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence.82.Act of a child under seven years of age: Nothing is an offence, which is done by a child under seven years of age.",
